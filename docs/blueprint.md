## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant yet professional blue (#2F80ED) to evoke trust and creativity. This color will be used for main interactive elements such as buttons and active states.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#EBF5FF) provides a clean and airy feel, allowing the products and content to stand out without causing distractions.
- Accent color: Complement the primary blue with a lively orange (#FFA500). It will be used sparingly to draw attention to important notifications, calls to action, or promotional highlights, creating a sense of excitement.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will ensure clarity and readability across the platform. Its modern yet humanist style is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) will be used for displaying any code snippets or order codes clearly and distinctly.
- Utilize a set of clean, consistent vector icons that align with the overall aesthetic. Icons should be intuitive and enhance the user experience.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the product listings and other sections of the website to maintain a sense of order and balance. Ensure that the layout is responsive across different devices.
